1. A line in the file should say `android:text="Hello user!"`. Changing the text inside the double-quotes will change the message shown in the application.

2. When the word `super` is misspelled, building the application should result in an error message at the bottom of the window saying `BUILD FAILED`. After fixing the word to be `super` again the build should succeed and you should be asked whether to update the application.
